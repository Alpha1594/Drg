TODO
Filter patients by regime

?Change DoseSchedule datatype (Currently Int should be Str)

//Create xml file of regimes
	Link it to patient form (Read from ability)
		Use to populate relevant data (Given a regime it can fill in default info)
			Highlight autopopulated fields to ensure they are checked

Create single set of file read/write functions (to work with Patient & regime data) in a class file (Makes it polymorphic, reduces code )
xml file for list of consultants (For the consultant drop-down Consultants.xml ::= <Consultant Code><Full Name> //Code show in list with Name as alt text)

Diagnosis and drugs data entry front end (List of drugs and illnesses, tickbox to avoid misspellings, suggest other drugs, avoid allergies/interactions)

Improve layout & aesthetics (Research design conventions, talk to user)
Build in help functions (Help Form, link to pdf)

Make record locations modifiable(Use file in fixed location to determine where the record files are stored).

	//Exe Icon
//Code PatientData btnReset	21/12/12

//Create search function in Regime	23/12/12
	/Resolve issue with searched list index != to real index value. 26/12/12

//Generate Struct to store all readings for regime data 3/1/13
	Implement into:
		CreateNewPatient
		DisplayCurrent
		UpdateCurrent
//Link record to the calculator class to calculate doses (Allows for automatic calculations) 4/1/13

Allow system to work when there is no existing patient file
	Set up method to generate an empty file

Form PatientData Modify Reset for existing patients

Front end to edit data for Regimes
DONE
Generated Forms:
	Main menu
	Calculators (Self-contained non recording)
	Patient listing
		Reads from patient records to generate list of patients
		Refreshes each time the form is activated
	Patient Data entry
		Can add new patient
		Recall and modify existing patients
Created first iteration of a struct to store patient data
Refresh Regime when patientdata closed/ updated
